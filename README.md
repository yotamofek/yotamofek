### Me, in a nutshell ðŸ¥œ

My name is Yotam and I've been obsessed with [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/) since 2018. Low-key open-source contributor, hoping to become more active.

Here are some PRs I'm pretty proud of:
- ðŸ¦ž https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/pull/10180
- ðŸ¦ž https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/pull/10139
- ðŸ¦ž https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/7264
- ðŸ¦ž https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/9496
- ðŸ¦ž https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/1890
- ðŸ¦ž https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/pull/713

A small but IMHO useful crate I published:
- ðŸ¦ž [yotamofek/reductor](https://github.com/yotamofek/reductor) ([docs](https://docs.rs/reductor))

I've also dabbled in being a singer-songwriter and have put out two records:
- ðŸ’¿ [I Am Big Foot (2013)](https://open.spotify.com/album/2LhcbU3GT7Xy0KsF3X93am)
- ðŸ’¿ [×¢×™×¨ × ×ž×œ (2015)](https://open.spotify.com/album/6kMLi3zAYfuEsh3v0z4AyW)

And have written a smart contract for an ICO launched by a start-up I worked for that has since shut down:
